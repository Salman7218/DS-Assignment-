    "\"\"\"1. What is the Probability density function?\n",
    "Ans.: The Probability Density Function (PDF) is a concept in probability theory and statistics. It describes the probability distribution of a \n",
    "continuous random variable. The PDF is a function that assigns probabilities to different values or intervals of a random variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Formally, the PDF is denoted as f(x), where x represents a specific value of the random variable. The PDF satisfies the following properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-negativity: The PDF is always non-negative for all values of x: f(x) ≥ 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "Integration: The area under the PDF curve over the entire range of possible values is equal to 1: ∫f(x)dx = 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "The PDF provides information about the likelihood of different values occurring for a continuous random variable. It is often graphically represented \n",
    "as a smooth curve, where the height of the curve at a given point represents the probability density at that point.\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate the probability of an event within a specific range, you can integrate the PDF over that range. For example, the probability that the \n",
    "random variable falls within the interval [a, b] is given by ∫[a, b] f(x)dx."

    "Ans.:There are several types of probability distributions, each with its own characteristics and applications. Here are some commonly encountered \n",

    "\n",
    "Uniform Distribution: In a uniform distribution, all outcomes within a given range are equally likely. The probability density function (PDF) is\n",
    "constant within the range and zero outside of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Normal Distribution (Gaussian Distribution): The normal distribution is one of the most widely used distributions. It is characterized by a symmetric\n",
    "bell-shaped curve. Many natural phenomena follow a normal distribution. The PDF of a normal distribution is defined by its mean and standard deviation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Binomial Distribution: The binomial distribution models the probability of obtaining a certain number of successes in a fixed number of independent \n",
    "Bernoulli trials. It is often used to describe situations with two possible outcomes (e.g., success or failure) and a fixed number of trials.\n",
    "\n",
    "Poisson Distribution: The Poisson distribution is used to model the number of events that occur within a fixed interval of time or space, given a \n",
    "known average rate of occurrence. It is often used for rare events.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exponential Distribution: The exponential distribution models the time between events in a Poisson process, where events occur continuously and \n",
    "independently at a constant average rate. It is commonly used to model waiting times or durations."

    "Ans.: The binomial distribution is a discrete probability distribution that models the number of successes in a fixed number of independent Bernoulli \n",
    "trials. Here are the key properties of the binomial distribution:\n",
    "\n",
    "Fixed number of trials: The binomial distribution assumes a fixed number of trials denoted by 'n'. Each trial can result in one of two outcomes: \n",
    "success or failure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Independent trials: The trials in a binomial distribution are assumed to be independent, meaning the outcome of one trial does not affect the outcome \n",
    "of other trials.\n",
    "\n",
    "Constant probability of success: The probability of success, denoted by 'p', remains constant for each trial. Similarly, the probability of failure, \n",
    "denoted by 'q' (where q = 1 - p), also remains constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "Discrete outcomes: The binomial distribution deals with discrete outcomes, as it counts the number of successes in 'n' trials. The possible values \n",
    "of the random variable follow a sequence of 0, 1, 2, ..., n.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two examples where the binomial distribution can be applied are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Coin Flips: Consider flipping a fair coin multiple times. Each flip can be considered a Bernoulli trial with two outcomes: heads or tails. If we\n",
    "are interested in the number of heads obtained in, let's say, 10 coin flips, we can model it using a binomial distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quality Control: In a manufacturing process, a company may randomly sample a batch of products and test them for defects. Let's say the company \n",
    "wants to know the probability of finding a certain number of defective items in a batch of 100. If the probability of a product being defective\n",
    "remains constant, the binomial distribution can be used to model this situation."

    "Ans.: The binomial distribution and Poisson distribution are both probability distributions used to model discrete events. While they share some \n",
    "similarities, they differ in terms of their assumptions and the types of events they are best suited for.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nature of Events:\n",
    "\n",
    "Binomial Distribution: The binomial distribution is used to model events that have a fixed number of independent trials, each with two possible \n",

    "Assumptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Binomial Distribution: The binomial distribution assumes that the trials are independent, and the probability of success remains constant throughout \n",
    "the trials. Each trial is assumed to have only two possible outcomes with a fixed probability of success.\n",
    "Poisson Distribution: The Poisson distribution assumes that the events occur randomly and independently at an average rate. It does not assume a fixed\n",
    "number of trials or a constant probability of success. Instead, it focuses on the average rate of events occurring over a specific interval.\n",
    "Parameters:\n",

    "Binomial Distribution: The binomial distribution is defined by two parameters: the number of trials (n) and the probability of success (p).\n",
    "Poisson Distribution: The Poisson distribution is defined by a single parameter: the average rate of events (λ) occurring in a fixed interval.\n",
    "Shape:\n",
    "\n",
    "Binomial Distribution: The binomial distribution typically forms a symmetric or skewed bell-shaped curve when the number of trials is large. As the\n",
