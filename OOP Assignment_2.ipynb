    "\"\"\"Q1. Which function is used to open a file? What are the different modes of opening a file? Explain each mode\n",
    "of file opening.\n",
    "In Python, the built-in function used to open a file is open().\n",
    "Syntax: 'open(file_path, mode)'\n",
    "Here, file_path represents the path or name of the file that you want to open, and mode specifies the mode in which you want to open the \n",
    "file.The mode parameter is optional and if you don't specify it, open() will assume the default mode of 'r' (read-only mode).\n",
    "There are several modes in which a file can be opened in Python. Here are the most common ones:\n",
    "1.'r' (Read mode): This mode is used to read the contents of a file. The file is opened in read-only mode and if the file does not exist, \n",
    "a FileNotFoundError is raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.'w' (Write mode): This mode is used to write data to a file. If the file already exists, it will be overwritten. If it does not exist, a \n",
    "new file will be created.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.'a' (Append mode): This mode is used to append data to an existing file. If the file does not exist, a new file will be created.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.'x' (Exclusive mode): This mode is used to create a new file, but it will raise a FileExistsError if the file already exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.'b' (Binary mode): This mode is used to open a file in binary mode. This mode should be used when working with non-text files, such \n",
    "as images or audio files.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.'t' (Text mode): This mode is used to open a file in text mode, which is the default mode. It is used when working with text files.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use these modes in various combinations, such as 'rb' for reading a binary file or 'w+' for both reading and writing a text file."

    "Q2. Why close() function is used? Why is it important to close a file?\n",
    "Ans.:In Python, the close() function is used to close a file after it has been opened using the open() function.\n",
    "Syntax: file_object.close().It is important to close a file because when a file is opened, it occupies some resources such as memory \n",
    "and CPU time, and keeping it open unnecessarily can lead to resource wastage. Closing a file releases these resources and makes them \n",
    "available for other processes.In addition to freeing up resources, closing a file ensures that any changes made to the file are properly \n",
    "saved. For example, if you open a file in write mode and write some data to it, the data will not be saved until you close the file. \n",
    "If you don't close the file, the changes made to it may be lost."
