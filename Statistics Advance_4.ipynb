    "Q1: What is the difference between a t-test and a z-test? Provide an example scenario where you would\n",

    "Ans.: A t-test and a z-test are statistical tests used to make inferences about population parameters based on sample data. The main difference \n",

    "\n",
    "A t-test is appropriate when the population standard deviation is unknown, and the sample size is relatively small (typically less than 30). It is\n",
    "used to determine if there is a significant difference between the means of two groups or to compare a sample mean to a known population mean when \n",
    "the population standard deviation is unknown. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Scenario for t-test: Suppose you want to compare the effectiveness of two different teaching methods (Method A and Method B) in improving students' \n",
    "test scores. You randomly select two groups of students, apply Method A to one group and Method B to the other group, and then measure their test \n",

    "Ans.:One-tailed and two-tailed tests are types of hypothesis tests used in statistics to determine the significance of a relationship or difference \n",
