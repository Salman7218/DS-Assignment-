    "Ans.: Probability Mass Function (PMF) and Probability Density Function (PDF) are mathematical concepts used to describe the probability distribution \n",

    "Probability Mass Function (PMF):\n",
    "The PMF is applicable to discrete random variables. It gives the probability of each possible value that the random variable can take. The PMF is \n",
    "defined as:\n",
    "PMF(x) = P(X = x)\n",
    "\n",
    "where X is the random variable and x is a specific value that X can take. The PMF satisfies two properties: 1) The probability of any value x is \n",
    "non-negative, 2) The sum of probabilities for all possible values equals 1.\n",

    "Example:\n",
    "Consider a fair six-sided die. The random variable X represents the outcome of a single roll. The PMF of X is:\n",

    "Probability Density Function (PDF):\n",
    "The PDF is applicable to continuous random variables. It represents the relative likelihood of a random variable taking on a specific value \n",
    "within a given interval. Unlike the PMF, the PDF does not directly give probabilities. Instead, it provides the density of probabilities.\n",
    "The PDF is defined as the derivative of the cumulative distribution function (CDF) and satisfies two properties: 1) The PDF is non-negative \n",

    "Ans.: The Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) is a concept used to describe the probability distribution of a random variable, both discrete \n",

    "\n",
    "Mathematically, the CDF is defined as:\n",
    "\n",

    "2) The CDF approaches 0 as x approaches negative infinity, 3) The CDF approaches 1 as x approaches positive infinity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Consider a fair six-sided die. The random variable X represents the outcome of a single roll. The CDF of X is:\n",
    "\n",
    "CDF(x) = P(X ≤ x)\n",

    "Why CDF is used:\n",
    "The CDF is useful for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "Probability calculation: The CDF allows you to calculate probabilities for random variables. For example, if you want to find the probability \n",

    "Determining percentiles: The CDF can be used to find percentiles or quantiles of a random variable. For instance, you can find the value x such \n",
