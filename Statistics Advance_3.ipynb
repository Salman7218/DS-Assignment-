    "Q1: What is Estimation Statistics? Explain point estimate and interval estimate.\n",
    "Ans.: Estimation statistics is a branch of statistics that involves estimating unknown population parameters based on sample data. When we don't have\n",
    "access to the entire population, we rely on statistical inference to make educated guesses about population characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Point Estimate:\n",
    "A point estimate is a single value that is used to estimate an unknown population parameter. It is based on sample data and provides an approximation \n",
    "of the true value of the parameter. For example, if we want to estimate the mean height of a population, we can calculate the mean height of a sample \n",
    "and use it as a point estimate for the population mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interval Estimate:\n",
    "An interval estimate is a range of values within which the population parameter is believed to lie. It takes into account the variability and \n",
    "uncertainty associated with the estimation process. The interval estimate is constructed based on the sample data and a chosen level of confidence. \n",
    "The level of confidence determines the probability that the interval contains the true parameter value.\n",
    "\n",
    "In interval estimation, we provide a lower and an upper bound for the parameter. For example, a 95% confidence interval for the population mean \n",
    "height might be [165 cm, 175 cm]. This means that we are 95% confident that the true population mean height falls between 165 cm and 175 cm.\n",
    "\n",
    "The width of the interval estimate is influenced by factors such as the sample size, variability of the data, and the chosen level of confidence. \n",
    "A higher level of confidence will result in a wider interval, as we want to be more certain that we capture the true parameter value."
