    "\"\"\"Q2. State and Explain the features of MongoDB.\n",
    "Ans.: MongoDB is a popular open-source NoSQL database that comes with a range of features that make it a popular choice for developers. Here are some \n",
    "of the key features of MongoDB:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Document-oriented data model: MongoDB uses a document-oriented data model, where data is stored as JSON-like documents with dynamic schemas. This \n",
    "makes it easy to store and retrieve complex and unstructured data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Scalability: MongoDB is highly scalable and can be easily scaled horizontally by adding more nodes to a cluster. This makes it ideal for handling \n",
    "large-scale applications and databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. High availability: MongoDB supports automatic failover and replica sets, ensuring that the database is always available, even in the event of a node\n",
    "failure.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Indexing and querying: MongoDB provides powerful indexing and querying capabilities, making it easy to search and analyze large volumes of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Aggregation: MongoDB supports aggregation queries, which enable developers to perform complex data analysis and aggregation operations in real-time.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Ad hoc queries: MongoDB supports ad hoc queries, allowing developers to quickly and easily retrieve data without the need to define a predefined \n",
    "schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Flexible schema: MongoDB's flexible schema allows developers to easily add or remove fields from a document without affecting other documents in \n",
    "the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Automatic sharding: MongoDB supports automatic sharding, which allows developers to partition data across multiple nodes in a cluster, improving \n",
    "scalability and performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Geographic distribution: MongoDB supports multi-region and global clusters, making it easy to distribute data across multiple regions for improved \n",
    "performance and availability."
