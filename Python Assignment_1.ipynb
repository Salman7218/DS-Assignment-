    "Q1.  Explain with an example each when to use a for loop and a while loop.\n",
    "Ans.: -'for' loop is typically used when you know the number of times you want to iterate over a block of code. It has a predetermined structure, with a counter variable and a set range or sequence to iterate over.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:Suppose you have a list of numbers and you want to print out each number in the list. Here's how you would use a for loop to do that:\n",
    "    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "    for number in numbers:\n",
    "        print(number)\n",
    "        \n",
    "In this case, the for loop iterates over each number in the numbers list and prints it out. Since we know the number of items in the list beforehand, a for loop is the appropriate choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "-'while' loop, on the other hand, is typically used when you want to iterate over a block of code as long as a certain condition is true. It does not have a predetermined number of iterations, so it can be more flexible than a for loop.\n",
    "Example:Suppose you want to keep asking a user for input until they type \"quit\". Here's how you would use a while loop to do that:\n",
    "\n",
    "        user_input = \"\"\n",
    "        while user_input != \"quit\":\n",
    "            user_input = input(\"Please enter a command ('quit' to exit): \")\n",
    "            print(\"You entered:\", user_input)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, the while loop iterates over the block of code as long as the user_input variable is not equal to \"quit\". This allows us to keep asking for input until the user types \"quit\". Since we don't know how many times the loop will run beforehand, a while loop is the appropriate choice.   \n"
