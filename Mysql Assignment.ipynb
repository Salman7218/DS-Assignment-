    "\"\"\"Q1. What is a database? Differentiate between SQL and NoSQL databases.\n",
    "Ans.: A database is a structured collection of data that is organized in a way that allows it to be easily managed, accessed, and updated. Databases \n",
    "are commonly used in many different applications, including business, scientific research, and entertainment.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL and NoSQL are two different types of databases that use different approaches to storing and retrieving data.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL (Structured Query Language) databases are relational databases that use tables to store and organize data. These databases use SQL to manage and\n",
    "manipulate the data. SQL databases are highly structured, and data is stored in a way that makes it easy to search, sort, and analyze. SQL databases\n",
    "are best suited for applications that require complex queries and transactions, such as financial systems or e-commerce sites.\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL (Not Only SQL) databases are non-relational databases that use a variety of data models, such as key-value pairs, documents, and graphs, to \n",
    "store data. NoSQL databases are highly scalable and flexible, and can handle large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data. NoSQL databases \n",
    "are best suited for applications that require fast and efficient data processing, such as social media platforms or real-time analytics systems.\n",
    "\n",

    "Ans.:DDL stands for Data Definition Language, which is a set of SQL commands used to define and manage the structure of a database. DDL commands \n",
    "are used to create, modify, and delete database objects such as tables, indexes, and views.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following are some common DDL commands and their purposes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. CREATE: This command is used to create new database objects such as tables, views, and indexes. For example, the following SQL command creates \n",
    "a new table named \"customers\" with columns for customer name, email, and phone number:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    CREATE TABLE customers (\n",
    "  customer_id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "  customer_name VARCHAR(50),\n",
    "  email VARCHAR(50),\n",
    "  phone VARCHAR(20)\n",
    ");\n",
    "\n",
    "2. DROP: This command is used to delete existing database objects such as tables, views, and indexes. For example, the following SQL command drops \n",
    "the \"customers\" table:\n",
    "\n",
    "    DROP TABLE customers;\n",
    "\n",
    "3. ALTER: This command is used to modify the structure of existing database objects such as tables, views, and indexes. For example, the following \n",
    "SQL command adds a new column named \"address\" to the \"customers\" table:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ALTER TABLE customers ADD address VARCHAR(100);\n",
    "\n",
    "4. TRUNCATE: This command is used to delete all the data from a table, while keeping its structure intact. For example, the following SQL command \n",
    "deletes all the data from the \"customers\" table:\n",
    "\n",
    "    TRUNCATE TABLE customers;\n",

    "Ans.: DML stands for Data Manipulation Language, which is a set of SQL commands used to manipulate the data within a database. DML commands are used \n",
    "to insert, update, and delete data within tables.\n",
    "The following are some common DML commands and their purposes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. INSERT: This command is used to insert new data into a table. For example, the following SQL command inserts a new record into the \"customers\" \n",

    "    \n",
    "2. UPDATE: This command is used to update existing data within a table. For example, the following SQL command updates the phone number of the \n",
    "customer with ID 1:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    UPDATE customers\n",
    "    SET phone = '555-555-5555'\n",
    "    WHERE customer_id = 1;\n",
    "    \n",
    "3. DELETE: This command is used to delete data from a table. For example, the following SQL command deletes the record for the customer with ID 1:\n",

    "Ans.: DQL stands for Data Query Language, which is a set of SQL commands used to retrieve data from a database. DQL commands are used to query and \n",
    "retrieve data from tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common DQL command is SELECT, which is used to retrieve data from one or more tables based on certain conditions. Here is an example of \n",

    "\n",
    "Suppose we have a table called \"employees\" with columns for employee ID, name, department, and salary. We can use SELECT to retrieve the names \n",

    "    SELECT name, salary\n",
    "    FROM employees\n",
    "    WHERE department = 'sales' AND salary > 50000;\n",

    "This command specifies that we want to select the \"name\" and \"salary\" columns from the \"employees\" table where the \"department\" column is equal to \n",
    "\"sales\" and the \"salary\" column is greater than 50,000. The results of this query will be a table with two columns: \"name\" and \"salary\", and the rows\n",
    "will contain the names and salaries of all employees in the \"sales\" department who earn more than $50,000 per year.\n",

    "Ans.: Primary key and foreign key are two important concepts in relational database design.\n",
    "\n",
    "A primary key is a column or set of columns in a table that uniquely identifies each row in that table. The primary key must be unique for each row \n",
    "and cannot contain null values. The primary key is used to enforce data integrity and ensure that there are no duplicate rows in the table. \n",
    "For example, in a table of employees, the primary key could be the employee ID, which uniquely identifies each employee.\n",
    "\n",
    "A foreign key is a column or set of columns in a table that refers to the primary key of another table. The foreign key establishes a relationship \n",
    "between the two tables, and it is used to ensure referential integrity between the tables. For example, in a table of orders, the customer ID column \n",
    "could be a foreign key that refers to the primary key of the customers table. This ensures that each order is associated with a valid customer.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, a primary key is used to uniquely identify each row in a table, while a foreign key is used to establish a relationship between two tables\n",
