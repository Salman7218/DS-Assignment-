    "\"\"\"Q1. hat is multithreading in python? hy is it used? Name the module used to handle threads in python.\n",
    "Ans.:Multithreading in Python refers to the process of running multiple threads of execution concurrently within a single program. Each thread \n",
    "represents a separate flow of control that can perform tasks in parallel with other threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multithreading is used in Python to achieve parallelism and improve the performance of certain types of tasks, such as I/O-bound operations \n",
    "(e.g., reading and writing files, network communication) or CPU-bound operations that can be parallelized (e.g., image processing, data analysis).\n",
    "\n",
    "The threading module in Python is used to handle threads. It provides a simple and efficient way to create, manage, and communicate between \n",
    "threads. With the threading module, you can create and start new threads, set thread-specific data, synchronize access to shared resources, \n",
    "and communicate between threads using various synchronization primitives such as locks, semaphores, and events.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use the threading module, you can import it as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "import threading\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, you can create a new thread by defining a function that represents the thread's behavior and passing it to the Thread constructor:\n",
    "\n",
    "def my_thread_function():\n",
    "    # thread behavior goes here\n",
    "\n",
    "my_thread = threading.Thread(target=my_thread_function)\n",
    "my_thread.start()\n",
    "\n",
    "The start() method starts the thread's execution, which runs the my_thread_function in a separate flow of control. You can also use various methods of \n",
    "the Thread class to manage the thread's state, such as join(), is_alive(), and setDaemon().\"\"\""

    "\"\"\"Q5. State advantages and disadvantages of multithreading\n",
    "Ans.:Multithreading is a powerful tool that allows programs to execute multiple threads of execution concurrently within the same process. However, \n",
    "like any tool, it has both advantages and disadvantages, which are discussed below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages of multithreading:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Increased performance: Multithreading allows programs to take advantage of the available CPU resources and execute multiple threads of execution \n",
    "concurrently. This can result in significant performance gains, especially in programs that perform computationally-intensive tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Improved responsiveness: Multithreading allows programs to perform tasks in the background while still allowing the user to interact with the \n",
    "program's user interface. This can improve the overall responsiveness of the program and enhance the user experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Simplified design: Multithreading can simplify the design of programs by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable units of work that can \n",
    "be executed concurrently. This can make the code easier to understand, test, and maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages of multithreading:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Increased complexity: Multithreading introduces additional complexity into programs, making them harder to understand, test, and debug. This is \n",
    "especially true in programs that involve shared resources, such as memory, files, or network connections, which can be difficult to manage in a\n",
    "multithreaded environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Synchronization issues: Multithreading requires careful synchronization of shared resources to prevent race conditions, deadlocks, and other \n",
    "synchronization issues. This can be difficult to achieve, especially in complex programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Increased resource usage: Multithreading can consume additional system resources, such as CPU cycles, memory, and I/O bandwidth. This can impact \n",
    "the performance of other programs running on the same system.\n",

    "\"\"\"6. Explain deadlocks and race conditions.\n",
    "Ans.: Deadlocks and race conditions are two common synchronization issues that can occur in multithreaded programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deadlocks occur when two or more threads are blocked waiting for each other to release a shared resource, such as a lock or a semaphore. Deadlocks \n",
    "can occur when multiple threads acquire locks in a different order, leading to a situation where each thread is waiting for a lock that is held by \n",
    "another thread, resulting in a deadlock.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider two threads T1 and T2 that need to acquire two locks L1 and L2, but they acquire them in a different order. T1 acquires L1 \n",

    "respective locks before being blocked while waiting for the other lock to be released, resulting in a deadlock.\n",
    "\n",
    "Race conditions occur when two or more threads access a shared resource concurrently without proper synchronization, leading to unexpected results. \n",
